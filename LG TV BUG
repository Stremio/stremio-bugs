Greetings! I've recently installed stremio on my LG TV and i've been experiencing several connection issues. The problems can be on the movies or subtitles, for example, we watch half of a movie, then we take a break of some minutes, and then, when we get back to watch the rest of the movie, it simply doesn't load, same thing, and more frequently, with the subtitles, we're watching normally and sometimes even if we close the movie and instantly play it back again, the subtitles, that were working perfectly a few seconds ago, simply do not load. We usually receive the "Failed to load external subtitles" error. One important thing to mention is that everything works 100% perfectly on other devices like our phones and computers, we play the same file from the same add-on with the same subtitle and everything works without any problems at all, but when we play on the TV it doesn't work. I think thats all. Thanks in advance! Great fan of your work! Ps: I just selected any operation system because it cannotbe blank, but i think the correct operation systems for LG TVs is WebOS
